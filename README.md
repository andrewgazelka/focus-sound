## Why pink noise + 40Hz?

These appear to have the best evidence for aiding focus and concentration:

- **Pink noise**: May help mask distracting sounds and improve sleep/focus
- **40Hz (gamma frequency)**: Some studies suggest it may enhance cognitive function

Don't take this too seriously though - your mileage may vary.
